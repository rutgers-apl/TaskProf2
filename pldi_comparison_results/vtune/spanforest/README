We profiled spanningForest with Intel VTune amplifier and generated
the initial hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The profile shows as hotspots a set of parallel
for regions in the program which are the regions that are executing
most frequently. Increasing the parallelism in these regions does not
increase the speedup of the program.

The profile also highlights that the program has high scheduling
overhead time which is attributed to a parallel for call. Reducing the
overhead of this region manually does not speedup the program.

The profile shows low threading efficiency which is indicates low
parallelism in the program. A further threading efficiency analysis
(in threading_efficiency_profile.png) shows a low cpu utilization and
hotspots in the program causing low parallelism. These were not the
regions that we identified with TaskProf.
