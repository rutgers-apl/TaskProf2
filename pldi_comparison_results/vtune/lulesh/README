We profiled lulesh with Intel VTune amplifier and generated the
initial hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The hotspots identified by VTune correspond to
parallel for regions and task execute regions in the program and the
profiler also indicates low parallelism. But increasing the
parallelism of these regions did not speedup the program.

The profile shows low microarchitechtural usage which can be
attributed to secondary effects. A further micro architectural
analysis (microarch_profile.png) shows that the program has good
cycles per instruction and but is memory bound with high local DRAM
latency. This was similar to the cause of secondary effect we
diagnosed with TaskProf, but VTune does not show what region is
causing the secondary effect.
