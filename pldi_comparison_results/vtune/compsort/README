We profiled comparison with Intel VTune amplifier and generated the
initial hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The profile shows the set of hotspots in the
program which correspond parallel for calls in sequence.h and IO.h,
and the quickSort function in quicksort.h. TaskProf identified regions
in transpose.h.

The profile also highlights that the program has high scheduling
overhead time.

The profile shows low microarchitechtural usage which can be
attributed to secondary effects. A further micro architectural
analysis (microarch_profile.png) shows that the program has secondary
effects due to instruction cache misses and branch
mispredictions. While this indicates that the program is experiencing
secondary effects VTune does not show what are the specific regions
causing secondary effects.
