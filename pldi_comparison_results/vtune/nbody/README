We profiled nbody with Intel VTune amplifier and generated the initial
hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The profile highlights a function "direct" which
occurs in the region identified by TaskProf.

While the program has high scheduling time overhead VTune does not
highlight it.

The profile shows low microarchitechtural usage which can be
attributed to secondary effects. A further micro architectural
analysis (microarch_profile.png) shows that the program has low
floating point vector capacity usage.
