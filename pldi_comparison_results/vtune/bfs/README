We profiled bfs program with Intel VTune amplifier and generated the
initial hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The hotspots belonging to the bfs program
correspond to parallel for regions in the program and were not the
regions identified by TaskProf2.

The profile shows low microarchitechtural usage which can be
attributed to secondary effects. A further analysis micro
architectural analysis (microarch_profile.png) shows that the program
has high branch mispredictions.
