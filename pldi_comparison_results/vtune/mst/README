We profiled minSpanningForest with Intel VTune amplifier and generated
the initial hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The profile shows the set of hotspots in the
program which correspond to parallel for regions and a serial function
quicksort.

The profile also highlights that the program has high scheduling
overhead time and attributes it to a parallel for region. Reducing the
overhead of this parallel for call does not speedup the program.

The profile shows low microarchitechtural usage which can be
attributed to secondary effects. A further micro architectural
analysis (microarch_profile.png) shows that the program has high
memory latency and branch mispredictions. While this indicates that
the program is experiencing secondary effects VTune does not show what
are the specific regions causing secondary effects.
