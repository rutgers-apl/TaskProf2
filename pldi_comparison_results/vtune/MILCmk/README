We profiled MILCmk with Intel VTune amplifier and generated the initial
hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The profile shows the set of hotspots in the
program which correspond to regions in the TBB runtime.

The profile also highlights that the program has high scheduling
overhead time but attributes them to TBB Scheduler Internal Calls.

The profile shows low microarchitechtural usage which can be
attributed to secondary effects. A further micro
architectural analysis (microarch_profile.png) shows that the program
has high cycles per instruction and is memory bound. While this
indicates that the program is experiencing secondary effects VTune
does not show what are the specific regions causing secondary effects.
