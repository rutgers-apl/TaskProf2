We profiled swaptions program with Intel VTune amplifier and generated
the initial hotspot profile. The profile is shown in the file
hotspot_profile.png. The profile highlights that the program has high
scheduling overhead time but attributes them to TBB Scheduler Internal
calls which are also shown as the hotspots in the program.
