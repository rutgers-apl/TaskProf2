We initially ran the nbody program with Coz's end-to-end profiling and
then profiled for throughput and latency by placing progress points in
the regions we had optimized using our profiler, TaskProf2.

End-to-end profile
------------------

The end_to_end_profile.png file shows a screenshot of the end-to-end
profile generated by Coz. It highlights two line, IO.h:70, IO.h:50
which will speedup up the program by at-most 1%.

Throughput profile
------------------
We then placed a throughput progress point at CK.C:790, which was at
the end of the body of a for loop we had optimized. The screenshot of
the throughput profile is shown in the file throughput_profile.png. It
shows that optimizing the line at CK.C:714 would speedup the program
by about 30%. This line lies with the for loop that we optimized.

Latency profile ---------------
Finally, we placed latency progress points around the for loop we
optimized in CK.C. The latency profile is shown in the file
latency_profile.png. The profile shows that by optimizing line
CK.C:715, which was in the loop we optimized, the program will slow
down.
