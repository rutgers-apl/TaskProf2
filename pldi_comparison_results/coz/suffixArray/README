We initially ran the suffixArray program with Coz's end-to-end
profiling and then profiled for throughput and latency by placing
progress points in the regions we had optimized using our profiler,
TaskProf2.

End-to-end profile
------------------
To perform end-to-end profiling we ran suffixArray with Coz 40 times.
The end_to_end_profile.png file shows a screenshot of the end-to-end
profile generated by Coz. It highlights a single line, pks.C:392
which slows down the program by 5%.

Throughput profile
------------------
We then placed a throughput progress point at merge.h:79, which was at
the end of the body of a region we had optimized. The screenshot of
the throughput profile is shown in the file throughput_profile.png. It
shows that optimizing line pks.C:49 will speedup the program by about
20%, while optimizing the line of pks.C:392 will not speedup the
program. Both the line do not occur in the region that we optimized.

Latency profile 
---------------
Finally, we placed latency progress points around the region we
optimized in merge.h. The latency profile is shown in the file
latency_profile.png. The profile shows that by optimizing lines
pks.C:64 and pks.C:392, the program will slow down.
