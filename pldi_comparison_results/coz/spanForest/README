We were unable to generate the end-to-end and throughput profiles for
spanning forest, inspite of profiling the program with Coz over 50
executions. We were able to generate the latency profile by adding
latency progress points around a region in graphIO.h that we
optimized.  The latency profile is shown in the file
latency_profile.png. The profile shows that by optimizing line
graphIO.h:172, which was in the loop we optimized, the program will
slow down by almost 50%.
