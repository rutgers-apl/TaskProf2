## Task creation overhead

We demonstrate how TaskProf highlights task creation overheads using a
test program. In the shell with TaskProf

        cd <ART_ROOT>/tests/sched_overhead/
	./test_task_creation 1
	$TP_GENPROF/gentprof

This generates the tasking overhead profile in the file
task_overhead_profile.csv. The profile shows that the program has a
high task creation overhead of 87% of the total useful work. Three
spawn sites at lines 46,47 and 69 contribute almost all of the
overhead at 35, 35, and 28 percent respectively.

Now, let us reduce the task creation overhead by increasing the
grainsize and generate the profile.

        ./test_task_creation 512
	$TP_GENPROF/gentprof

In the task_overhead_profile.csv, the overall task creation overhead
reduced from 87% to 4%.
